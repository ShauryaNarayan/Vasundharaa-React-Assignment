Vasundharaa-React-Assignment:
This project is a Single Page Application (SPA) submitted for the React Developer Internship. It combines five specific tasks into one dashboard to demonstrate proficiency in React, State Management, and LocalStorage persistence.

Project Features
Task 1: Enhanced Todo App

Allows adding, deleting, and completing tasks.

Saves tasks to browser LocalStorage so they persist after a refresh.

Includes filtering for "All", "Active", and "Completed" tasks.

Task 2: Form Handling & Validation

A registration form with Name, Email, and Password fields.

Includes real-time validation for empty fields and invalid emails.

Features a "Show/Hide Password" toggle.

Task 3: Dynamic Progress Bar

Three slider inputs that control a main progress bar.

The main bar calculates the average of all inputs.

The bar changes color dynamically (Red for low, Green for high) based on the value.

Task 4: Persistent Countdown Timer

A countdown timer with Start, Pause, and Reset buttons.

Uses timestamps to ensure the timer resumes correctly even if the page is refreshed.

Task 5: Live Search

A search bar that filters a list of items.

Highlights the matching text characters in bold as the user types.

Technologies Used:

React.js (Vite)

Tailwind CSS

JavaScript (ES6+)
